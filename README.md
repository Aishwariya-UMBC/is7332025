IS 733: Collaborative Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Project

## Overview
Welcome to the **Collaborative Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery** repository, part of the IS 733 curriculum at UMBC for Spring 2025. This project serves as a hands-on, collaborative space where students apply theoretical concepts in data mining to practical problems, using tools like Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and WEKA. Beyond its immediate academic use, this repository is designed to grow and serve as a resource for future students, fostering innovation, collaboration, and a deeper understanding of data mining.

## Objectives
This project aims to:
- Provide students with real-world experience in applying data mining techniques such as classification, clustering, and association rule mining.
- Encourage teamwork and co-location by fostering collaboration among diverse teams.
- Build a shared knowledge base that will be continuously enhanced by future students.
- Highlight the importance of ethical considerations in data mining and promote responsible data practices.
- Prepare students for research and practical challenges in the rapidly evolving field of data science.

## Vision for Future Students
This repository is more than just a class project; it is a foundation for future learning and collaboration. Future students are encouraged to:
- Build upon the existing work, contributing innovative ideas and solutions.
- Leverage the repository as a resource for exploring advanced data mining topics and techniques.
- Collaborate with peers to tackle challenging data problems and publish findings.
- Use this space as a stepping stone for academic and professional endeavors in data science.

## How to Contribute
We welcome contributions to this growing repository. Here’s how you can get involved:
1. **Fork this Repository**: Create your copy of the project and experiment freely.
